# Customer Churn Analysis Using Machine Learning
## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical problem for subscription-based businesses. This project aims to predict whether a customer will leave a service using historical customer data and machine learning models.By identifying high-risk customers early, businesses can take proactive actions to improve customer retention.
## 🎯 Objective
1. Predict customer churn using machine learning
2. Identify key factors influencing customer churn
3. Provide actionable business insights
## 🗂️ Project Workflow
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Loading & Inspection
3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Feature Engineering
6. Model Training
7. Model Evaluation
8. Business Insights & Recommendations
## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-related information such as:
I. Demographics
II. Account information
III. Service usage
IV. Billing details
V. Churn status (target variable)
## 🧠 Models Used
- Logistic Regression 
  Performance evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Random Forest Classifier
  Performance evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
## 📈 Key Insights
- Month-to-month contract customers are more likely to churn
- Higher monthly charges increase churn risk
- Longer tenure significantly reduces churn probability
## 📈 Model Evaluation Metrics
Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix
## 💼 Business Recommendations
- Encourage long-term contracts offer discounts or benefits for yearly and two-year plans.
- Target high-risk customers focus retention campaigns on customers with high monthly charges and low tenure.
- Improve onboarding experience engage new customers early to reduce churn during initial months.
- Bundle services provide value-added service packages to increase customer stickiness.
- Use churn predictions proactively contact customers predicted to churn with personalized offers or support.
- Continuous model improvement retrain the model periodically with new customer data to maintain accuracy.
## ✅ Conclusion
- The customer churn analysis successfully identified key factors influencing churn behavior.
- Customers with month-to-month contracts show a significantly higher churn rate.
- Higher monthly charges increase the likelihood of customer churn.
- Customers with longer tenure are more loyal and less likely to churn.
- The machine learning model demonstrated good predictive performance in classifying churned and non-churned customers.
- The analysis proves that data-driven decision-making can effectively support customer retention strategies.
- This project provides a strong foundation for further improvements and real-world deployment.
